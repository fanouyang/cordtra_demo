#### This is a demo of a part of my dissertation research, demonstrating the temporal analysis of students' online collaborative inquiry and the instructor's online involvement within an online course. In this demo, I only show three weeks from the beginning to the middle and end of the course (i.e., week 2, week 8, and week 14).
